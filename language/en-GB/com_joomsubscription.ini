X_CROSSPLAN_UPGRADE="Upgrade"
X_UPGRADE_STEP_DESCR="<p>This is how we will recalculate left days to take in account when upgrade to another plan. For example you have Plan A - 30 days/10USD. And Plan B - 60 days/20USD. User have plan A for 15 days but want to upgrade to plan B. If you have recalculation step = 1, then we will first calculate how many steps in th current plan. 30 days in plan / 1 day in one step = 30 steps. Now we calculat price per step. 10USD / 30 steps = 0.33USD a step. Now we calculate how many steps we passed. ceil(15 days / 1 day) = 15 steps. Not we see now many steps left. 30 steps in plan - 15 steps passed = 15 steps left. Now 15 steps left * 0.33USD = 4.99USD. This is how much left and amount of discount that will be applied during upgrade.</p><p>Let's take 10 days in step. 30 / 10 = 3 steps. 10USD / 3 = 3.33USD per step. ceil(15 days passed / 10 days in step) = 2 steps passed. 3 - 2 = 1 step left or only 3.66USD discount.</p>"
